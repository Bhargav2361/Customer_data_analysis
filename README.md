# Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Dashboard

## Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end **data analytics workflow**, starting from raw data ingestion to actionable business insights. It covers data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL-based analysis, dashboard creation, and reporting. The goal is to transform raw data into meaningful insights that support data-driven decision-making.

## Dataset
- Retail / business transaction dataset  
- Contains customer, sales, product, and time-based information  
- Source: Public dataset / simulated business data  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **SQL**: PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server  
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards and visual analytics  
- **Gamma**: Presentation (PPT) creation  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Analysis and documentation  

---

## Project Steps
1. **Data Loading**
   - Loaded dataset using Python (Pandas)
   - Initial inspection and schema understanding  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed trends, distributions, and outliers
   - Identified missing values and data inconsistencies  

3. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing data and duplicates
   - Standardized data formats and data types  

4. **SQL Analysis**
   - Created and executed SQL queries for KPI calculation
   - Used joins, CTEs, and aggregations for insights  

5. **Dashboard Creation**
   - Built interactive Power BI dashboards
   - Visualized KPIs, trends, and performance metrics  

6. **Reporting & Presentation**
   - Summarized findings in a structured report
   - Created a PPT using Gamma for stakeholder communication  

---

## Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard includes:
- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Sales and revenue trends
- Customer behavior insights
- Filters for dynamic analysis

---

## Results & Insights
- Identified key business trends and performance drivers
